## Artem Hutvarev

Technology work focused on phase-field computation, topology operators, and synchronization dynamics.

**Primary project:**  
TOCTET Kernel Architecture  
https://github.com/hutvarev/TOCTET-Kernel-Architecture

**Focus**
- bounded oscillator fields  
- topology as program  
- SDF computation  
- observability systems  
- swarm synchronization  

TOCTET is a phase-synchronous field architecture where execution emerges from
synchronization across bounded fields rather than instruction scheduling.
